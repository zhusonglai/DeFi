# DeFi: Real-Time Smart Contract Insight Engine

## About
DeFi is a Real-Time Smart Contract Insight Engine that leverages Machine Learning and Distributed Ledger Analysis capabilities. It is designed to provide deep insights into smart contracts by analyzing blockchain data in real time, aiding in security, auditing, and transparency for decentralized finance applications.

## Features
- Real-time analysis of smart contracts on blockchain networks.
- Machine Learning techniques for anomaly detection and pattern recognition.
- Distributed ledger data integration for comprehensive insights.
- Suitable for developers, auditors, and researchers in the decentralized finance ecosystem.

## Installation
To install and run DeFi, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zhusonglai/DeFi.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
